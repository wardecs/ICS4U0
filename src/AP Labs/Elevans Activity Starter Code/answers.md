### Activity 2:

1. Explain in your own words the relationship between a deck and a card.



2. Consider the deck initialized with the statements below. How many cards does the deck contain?
String[] ranks = {"jack", "queen", "king"};
String[] suits = {"blue", "red"};
int[] pointValues = {11, 12, 13};
Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);
3. The game of Twenty-One is played with a deck of 52 cards. Ranks run from ace (highest) down to 2
(lowest). Suits are spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs as in many other games. A face card has point
value 10; an ace has point value 11; point values for 2, …, 10 are 2, …, 10, respectively. Specify the
contents of the ranks , suits , and pointValues arrays so that the statement
Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);
initializes a deck for a Twenty-One game.
4. Does the order of elements of the ranks , suits , and pointValues arrays matter?
